# Backbone, The Primer #

This primer is adapted from Greg MacWilliam's _Backbone, the Primer_ particularly for use on the Data Community DC website. It is broken up into four parts, rather than one long post:

1. Introduction
2. Models and Collections
3. Views
4. A Simple Backbone App. 

These posts are scheduled to be published on Data Community DC in March, 2014.
